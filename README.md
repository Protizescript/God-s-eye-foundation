We are a nonprofit fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world.it focuses on improving people's health and giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty.
God's eye foundation focuses  its grant-making and advocacy efforts on eliminating global inequities and increasing opportunities for those in need through programs that address, for example, global agricultural and economic development, medical research and public health initiatives in developing countries, and the improvement of education and access to information in Africa.
the program helps increase opportunities for farmers in developing countries and supports research on the production of rice and flour enriched with micronutrients. The program also seeks to increase financial services to the poor by funding projects that examine the effectiveness of loans, insurance, financial planning, and financial education in impoverished countries.
